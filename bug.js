This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a cleanup function that throws an error.  The cleanup function might try to access a component's state or props after the component has unmounted, leading to an unexpected behavior. This is especially common when dealing with asynchronous operations within the `useEffect` hook that outlive the component's lifecycle.
